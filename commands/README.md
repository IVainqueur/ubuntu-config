# Useful commands

This folder contains a list of commands that I find useful and want to not forget (to be sorted later)

-   bash`ln -s [originalfile] [linkfile]` : to create a _soft_ symbolic link of `originalpath` as `linkfile`
-   bash`sudo update-initramfs -u`: updates the `initramfs`, a virtual file system that is part of the boot procedure. This is for when you have changed some of the boot configuration with `plymouth`.
